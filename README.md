# Towards Semantic Versioning of Open Pre-trained Language Model Releases on Hugging Face
Recently, WhatsApp and Facebook have integrated Meta AI, built upon their latest and most advanced technology, Llama-3, into their applications. This allows users to leverage Meta AI for various tasks.
These advanced technologies are called pre-trained models. Many pre-trained models exist for different tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio processing. The most common application of these technologies is large language processing (LLP), a subfield of NLP that focuses on enabling machines to understand,interpret, and generate human language. Pre-trained language models (PTLMs) are specifically designed for comprehending human language.
PTLMs vary in size, with parameter counts ranging from thousands to billions. Models with over 1 million parameters are sometimes called large language models, and are otherwise called PTLMs in our study, such as Llama, GPT, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa.
The good news is that many of these models are accessible through downstream model registries, allowing developers and users to leverage PTLMs in their applications. Several registries offer free access to pre-trained models for various downstream tasks, including Hugging Face (HF), ONNX, PyTorch, and Modelhub. Hugging Face is the largest of these,boasting over 800,000 pre-trained models. Exploring practices on this registry is valuable.
However, selecting the appropriate PTLM for specific applications can be challenging. Users face various hurdles, such as:
- Search terms: How to find the most suitable model?
- Variants: Which variant of PTLLM is available and recommended?
- Versions: What versions are available?

Unfortunately, no current documentation informs users about how these models are versioned on the model registries, the types of variants model developers push to model registry, and the naming convention. The AI community has yet to address these issues.
Therefore, it's crucial to explore the current naming conventions, versioning practices, and available variants of PTLMs and their characteristics. Similarly, it's important to understand if the versioning conventions, especially on Hugging Face align with those used in software development.

In this case, we employed a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative analysis) to make observations, which are discussed below.

## Naming and Versioning practices of PTLMs on HuggingFace
On HuggingFace, approximately 148 different naming practices are observed, indicating a significant level of inconsistency across repositories. This discrepancy may stem from a mismatch between user preferences and practical naming practices for PTLMs. Moreover, 13 key terms frequently appear in PTLLM names, including identifiers, base models, parameter sizes, training mechanisms, descriptions, variant types, versions, tasks, datasets, targeted languages, development dates, owning nationalities, and some ambiguous terms.

Regarding versioning, two main types of identifiers were observed: major (e.g., v1, v2) and minor (e.g., v1.x, v2.x), with major identifiers being more common. Additionally, files associated with PTLLM releases undergo frequent changes, with over 192 different file types identified across repositories. These files are categorized into five groups: Code files, Documentation files, Data and Configuration files, Model files, and Other files. The most frequently changed files are model binary files and data & configuration files.

Furthermore, there are 11 different file extensions used in storing model weights on Hugging Face, including .safetensor, .bin, .pt, .model, .onnx, .meta, .tflite, .mlmodel, .ckpt, .mdl, and .pb. Notably, .safetensor is the most prevalent extension, potentially indicating a community shift towards secure and efficient storage solutions.

## PTLMs provenance, variant types and their characteristics on Hugging Face
In evaluating PTLMs on Hugging Face, we've noted a focus on transparency and reproducibility. Many PTLMs are released with their configuration files, indicating an effort towards reproducible model training configurations. Since 2022, 299 unique base models have been released on Hugging Face, with Gemma, Mistral, Llama, Bert, and Mixtral being the most prevalent models. However, only 24% out of 52,227 of these PTLMs include information about their training datasets in their repositories.

Model developers on Hugging Face employ 15 different keywords, such as ft, deduped, and distilled, to denote variant types. These keywords are classified into four groups: Fine-tuning, Deduplication, Quantization, and Knowledge Distillation. Fine-tuned models emerge as the most prevalent, but a significant portion of released models do not specify their variant type.

Concerningly, only a small percentage of variant models include their training datasets in their repositories—22% for Fine-tuned models, 23% for Quantized models, 25% for Deduped models, and 36% for Distilled models. This transparency gap may impede user comprehension.

In terms of transparency, we found that 67% of released PTLMs on Hugging Face have model cards—a significant increase of 7% compared to previous literature findings, 60%. However, there is a notable disparity in model card release among variant types, with Deduped models exhibiting particularly low release rates at 31%. There are statistically significant differences between the release of model cards and the variant types of a model.

## Changes that lead to versioning of PTLLMs on Hugging Face.
We explored the versioning practices of PTLMs on Hugging Face to understand the changes leading to new versions. Developers use major and minor identifiers similar to those in software engineering. Our analysis revealed that only 43% of major versions and 35% of minor versions have their predecessors (for those with more than one version of a model) available, indicating poor versioning practices.
We found that changes to PTLMs for new versions include modifications to base models, binary files, binary file pointers, README documents, and model cards. Statistically significant changes were observed only in model binary files and base models, suggesting these are key differentiators for new versions.
Further examination of README and model cards for versions with changes in model weight files revealed 28 different changes between major versions and 8 between minor versions. Interestingly, all minor version changes also appeared in major versions. We categorized these changes into nine groups: configuration change, model architecture change, license change, performance change, dataset change, training library change, energy consumption change, evaluation metric change, and other changes. However, there was no statistical significance between changes in major and minor versions, suggesting arbitrary use of these identifiers by developers.
Lastly, we discovered that changes in configuration settings, training libraries, and evaluation metrics are associated with model performance improvements. This implies that altering these aspects can enhance the performance of new PTLLM versions.
