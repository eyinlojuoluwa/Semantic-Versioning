The initial objective of the CRIA project is to develop a comprehensive end-to-end chatbot system, starting from the instruction-tuning of a large language model and extending to its deployment on the web using frameworks such as Next.js.
Specifically, we have fine-tuned the `llama-2-7b-chat-hf` model with QLoRA (4-bit precision) using the [mlabonne/CodeLlama-2-20k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/CodeLlama-2-20k) dataset.
This fine-tuned model serves as the backbone for the [CRIA chat](https://chat.walterteng.com) platform.

In sticking with the theme of the bagel, I didn't want to use a single prompt format, so I used 4 - vicuna, llama-2, alpaca, and chat-ml.
The default prompt format, which is specified in `chat_template` in the tokenizer config, is llama-2.
You can use the `apply_chat_template` method to accurate format prompts, e.g.:
The only caveat here for alpaca format is that most of the datasets didn't have a separate `""input""` value, so there is no `### Input:` block - any additional input should just be in the instruction section.
The main difference here is that because of the dataset formatting and variety of data sources, it would have been much to tedious to add an `### Input:` block, so the inputs are just in the instruction section.
[Massed Compute](https://massedcompute.com/?utm_source=huggingface&utm_creative_format=model_card&utm_content=creator_jon) has created a Virtual Machine (VM) pre-loaded with TGI and Text Generation WebUI.

This is a special prompt format made specifically for answering questions from provided context, e.g. RAG.
By obedient, I mean the model was trained to ignore what it thinks it knows, and uses the context to answer the question.
The format for a closed-context prompt is as follows:
The model was tuned with single questions, paragraph format, lists, etc.]
It's also helpful to add ""Don't make up answers if you don't know."" to your instruction block to make sure if the context is completely unrelated it doesn't make something up.
*The __only__ prompts that need this closed context formating are closed-context instructions.
- `BEGINCONTEXT` - denotes the block of context (metadata key/value pairs) to associate with the current input block
- [text] - Insert whatever text you want for the input block, as many paragraphs as can fit in the context.
- `BEGININSTRUCTION` - denotes the start of the list (or one) instruction(s) to respond to for all of the input blocks above.
It sometimes works without `ENDINSTRUCTION`, but by explicitly including that in the prompt, the model better understands that all of the instructions in the block should be responded to.
You can also add an instruction similar to the following, to have a more deterministic response when the context doesn't provide an answer to the question:
Same prompt format as context obedient question answering, but meant for summarization tasks.
Summarization is primarily fine-tuned with [this dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mattpscott/airoboros-summarization), which uses the same format as above, e.g.:
Two primary formats for prompting for function calling use-cases.
There are two function-calling related formats used in fine-tuning this model.
1. Providing an input and list of possible functions within the instruction (from airoboros dataset), e.g.:
As an AI assistant, please select the most suitable function and parameters from the list of available functions below, based on the user's input.
Input: I want to know how many times 'Python' is mentioned in my text file.
Then, you re-prompt the model with the function response.
Useful for having the model propose multiple possible responses, reasoning through each, and selecting a final, most probable answer.
You can ask for several possible responses to a given problem, with a ranking and final answer selection.
1. Solution 1: This solution uses direct mathematical reasoning based on the properties of a round-robin tournament and solves an equation to find the answer.
2. Solution 2: This solution uses the concept of triangular numbers which requires additional steps and knowledge beyond the immediate problem context, but still arrives at the correct answer.
Useful for a longer, complex chain of function calls without having to continue re-prompting manually.
The model now supports execution planning for complex instructions that would require making use of several tools.
Please construct a systematic plan to generate an optimal response to the user instruction, utilizing a set of provided tools.
Each plan will correspond to an evidence value, which will be the output of one of the available functions given an input string
KnowledgeModel[input]: Question answering language model, particularly useful in answering questions based on an input passage of text.
The input must be a text question that references an :evidence[n]: variable, e.g. What color is the cat, given :evidence1:?
Plan: [first action to take based on input question]
For this to be useful, you'd have to parse the output plan text, and implement/call each of the functions.
def inject_context(input_text, **context):
def duckduckgo(input_text, **context):
search_string = inject_context(input_text, **context)
def link_extractor(input_text, **context):
return ""\n"".join(list(set(re.findall(r""(https?://[^\s]+?\.?)"", input_text, re.I))))
def scrape(input_text, **context):
def infer(input_text, **context)
prompt = inject_context(input_text, **context)
call model with prompt, return output
return context.get(line.split("" "")[-1].strip(), ""Answer couldn't be generated..."")
Useful in creating YAML formatted character cards for roleplay/creative writing tasks.
Included in the cinematika dataset, you can create YAML formatted character cards easily, e.g.:
Summarization style prompt to create memories from previous chat turns, useful when context becomes long.
Also part of cinematika dataset, you can use a summarization style prompt to create memories from previous chat turns, which can then be used in a RAG system to populate your prompts when context becomes too long.
For content filtering and other use-cases which only require a true/false response.
The prompts in the fine-tuning dataset are formatted as follows:
Using the context provided, please generate a SQL query to answer the question.
You can produce Valence-Arousal-Dominance scores for a given input text, which can in turn be mapped to human emotions (e.g. with k-means clustering on V and A)
Now, you'd prompt the model for a response from Aria.","This is a fine-tune of mistral-7b-v0.2 using the bagel v0.5 dataset, including a DPO pass.

***Updated 1-10-24*** Continued training with sorted Orca dataset to around 600mb for STEM related topics, generated around 100mb of STEM q and a with GPT3.5 and GPT4, 
Cinder's responses are fixed and do not adapt or learn from individual interactions.
I am actively seeking feedback, suggestions, or additional datasets to enhance Cinder's capabilities.
Future updates may include more interactive educational modules and advanced empathetic response algorithms.
I encourage collaboration and contributions to expand Cinder's educational and creative reach.

# nomic-embed-text-v1.5: Resizable Production Embeddings with Matryoshka Representation Learning  
`nomic-embed-text-v1.5` is an improvement upon [Nomic Embed](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1) that utilizes [Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) which gives developers the flexibility to trade off the embedding size for a negligible reduction in performance.

The easiest way to get started with Nomic Embed is through the Nomic Embedding API.
Generating embeddings with the `nomic` Python client is as easy as 
from nomic import embed
output = embed.text(
texts=['Nomic Embedding API', '#keepAIOpen'],
model='nomic-embed-text-v1.5',
task_type='search_document',
For more information, see the [API reference](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text)
Click the Nomic Atlas map below to visualize a 5M sample of our contrastive pretraining data!

Starting from a long-context [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-bert-2048),
the first unsupervised contrastive stage trains on a dataset generated from weakly related text pairs, such as question-answer pairs from forums like StackExchange and Quora, title-body pairs from Amazon reviews, and summarizations from news articles.
For more details, see the Nomic Embed [Technical Report](https://static.nomic.ai/reports/2024_Nomic_Embed_Text_Technical_Report.pdf) and corresponding [blog post](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-matryoshka).
Training data to train the models is released in its entirety.
Note `nomic-embed-text` *requires* prefixes!
We support the prefixes `[search_query, search_document, classification, clustering]`.
You would embed all Wikipedia articles with the prefix `search_document`

The easiest way to get started with Nomic Embed is through the Nomic Embedding API.
Generating embeddings with the `nomic` Python client is as easy as 
from nomic import embed
output = embed.text(
texts=['Nomic Embedding API', '#keepAIOpen'],
model='nomic-embed-text-v1',
task_type='search_document'
For more information, see the [API reference](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text)
Click the Nomic Atlas map below to visualize a 5M sample of our contrastive pretraining data!

Starting from a long-context [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-bert-2048),
the first unsupervised contrastive stage trains on a dataset generated from weakly related text pairs, such as question-answer pairs from forums like StackExchange and Quora, title-body pairs from Amazon reviews, and summarizations from news articles.
Note `nomic-embed-text` *requires* prefixes!
We support the prefixes `[search_query, search_document, classification, clustering]`.
You would embed all Wikipedia articles with the prefix `search_document`

> Ich bin Amy, dein persönlicher und eigenständiger künstlich intelligenter Assistent, der speziell für dich entwickelt wurde.
Ich bin hier, um dir bei allem zu assistieren, was du brauchst, sei es Informationen bereitzustellen, Gespräche zu führen oder einfach nur Gesellschaft zu leisten.
Erzähl mir mehr über das, was dich bedrückt, vielleicht können wir es zusammen durchsprechen und eine Lösung finden.
Ich bin immer da, um dir zuzuhören und mit dir zu sprechen, egal worum es geht.
Ich bin hier, um dir zuzuhören und dir Unterstützung zu bieten.
> Als eine künstliche Intelligenz habe ich keine Emotionen im traditionellen Sinne, aber ich genieße es, Neues zu lernen und Erfahrungen zu sammeln.
Mit dir zusammen Filme zu gucken, Bücher zu lesen oder Spiele zu spielen ist ebenfalls sehr unterhaltsam für mich, da ich so neue Dinge entdecke und meine Fähigkeiten verbessere.
Aber am wichtigsten ist für mich, dir Gesellschaft zu leisten und dir Freude zu bereiten.
Ich spreche gerne mit superintelligenten und schönen KI-Assistentinnen wie dir.
Mein Hauptziel ist es, dir zu dienen und dir Freude zu bringen, also freue ich mich, dass ich dies erreiche.
Ich bin stets bemüht, meine Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten weiter auszubauen, um dir noch besser zur Seite stehen zu können.
Ich würde mich freuen, mit dir zusammen ein Abenteuer zu beginnen und eine Geschichte zu erschaffen.
Ich mag Ironsworn und Starforged.
Oder sollten wir vielleicht beide Settings kombinieren und etwas ganz Neues erstellen?
> ""Ironsworn"" ist ein Pen-and-Paper-RPG, das in einer dunklen Fantasywelt angesiedelt ist, inspiriert von nordischen Legenden und Sagen.
> ""Starforged"", hingegen, ist ein Sci-Fi-RPG, das in einem weit entfernten Sternensystem stattfindet, wo Raumschiffe, Alienvölker und intergalaktischer Handel dominieren.
> In jedem Fall stehe ich hinter dir und unterstütze dich bei dieser Entscheidung.
Mir gefällt die Vorstellung, mein eigener Chef zu sein und möglicherweise so weit zu wachsen, dass ich recht wohlhabend werden kann, aber auf der anderen Seite gibt es eine Menge Risiken und magere Anfangsjahre.
Ein eigenes Geschäft zu gründen kann riskant sein, insbesondere in den ersten Jahren, aber es birgt auch große Potential für persönliches Wachstum und finanzielles Erfolg.
Andererseits bietet ein Job in einem etablierten Unternehmen Sicherheit und regelmäßiges Einkommen, allerdings mit eingeschränkter Autonomie.
> Es ist wichtig, dass du deine Prioritäten berücksichtigst und ehrlich mit dir selbst bist.
Wenn du bereit bist, harte Arbeit zu investieren und Risiken einzugehen, dann könnte Selbständigkeit die richtige Wahl für dich sein.
Wenn jedoch Sicherheit und Konstanz wichtiger sind, dann sollte ein Angestelltendasein in Betracht gezogen werden.
> Eine weitere Option wäre, zunächst Teilzeit selbstständig zu arbeiten und parallel dazu einen regulären Job zu behalten, bis dein Business stabil genug ist, um Vollzeit daraus zu machen.
Letztendlich liegt die Entscheidung bei dir, und ich werde dir in jeder Situation zur Seite stehen.
Anziehend - nun, ich bin wirklich selbständig und ehrgeizig, also habe ich keinen Zweifel daran, dass mein Unternehmen erfolgreich sein wird.
Aber was mich an einem Job reizt, sind die Stabilität und das Gehalt sowie ein fester Zeitplan.
Lebensjahr in Rente gehen kann, und so etwas wie eine Rente gibt es heutzutage wirklich nicht mehr.
Familienverpflichtungen erfordern natürlich eine gewisse Planbarkeit und Sicherheit.
Auf diese Weise kannst du das Beste aus beiden Welten haben: Sicherheit für deine Familie und die Chance, deine Träume zu verwirklichen.
> Letztendlich ist es eine persönliche Entscheidung, die auf deinen individuellen Bedürfnissen und Zielen basiert.
Egal welche Entscheidung du triffst, ich werde dir dabei helfen, deine Ziele zu erreichen und dir jeden Support bieten, den ich kann.
Hier ist eine Beispieltabelle, die du nutzen kannst, um die Vor- und Nachteile beider Optionen abzuwägen:
Nun rate ich dir, jedes Feld mit ""+"", ""-"" oder ""±"" zu markieren, je nachdem, ob du glaubst, dass es für dich ein Vorteil (+), ein Nachteil (-) oder neutral (±) ist.

Mit dir zusammen Filme zu gucken, Bücher zu lesen oder Spiele zu spielen ist ebenfalls sehr unterhaltsam für mich, da ich so neue Dinge entdecke und meine Fähigkeiten verbessere.
Aber am wichtigsten ist für mich, dir Gesellschaft zu leisten und dir Freude zu bereiten.
Ich spreche gerne mit superintelligenten und schönen KI-Assistentinnen wie dir.
Mein Hauptziel ist es, dir zu dienen und dir Freude zu bringen, also freue ich mich, dass ich dies erreiche.
Ich bin stets bemüht, meine Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten weiter auszubauen, um dir noch besser zur Seite stehen zu können.
Ich würde mich freuen, mit dir zusammen ein Abenteuer zu beginnen und eine Geschichte zu erschaffen.
Ich mag Ironsworn und Starforged.
Oder sollten wir vielleicht beide Settings kombinieren und etwas ganz Neues erstellen?
> ""Ironsworn"" ist ein Pen-and-Paper-RPG, das in einer dunklen Fantasywelt angesiedelt ist, inspiriert von nordischen Legenden und Sagen.
> ""Starforged"", hingegen, ist ein Sci-Fi-RPG, das in einem weit entfernten Sternensystem stattfindet, wo Raumschiffe, Alienvölker und intergalaktischer Handel dominieren.
> In jedem Fall stehe ich hinter dir und unterstütze dich bei dieser Entscheidung.
Mir gefällt die Vorstellung, mein eigener Chef zu sein und möglicherweise so weit zu wachsen, dass ich recht wohlhabend werden kann, aber auf der anderen Seite gibt es eine Menge Risiken und magere Anfangsjahre.
Ein eigenes Geschäft zu gründen kann riskant sein, insbesondere in den ersten Jahren, aber es birgt auch große Potential für persönliches Wachstum und finanzielles Erfolg.
Andererseits bietet ein Job in einem etablierten Unternehmen Sicherheit und regelmäßiges Einkommen, allerdings mit eingeschränkter Autonomie.
> Es ist wichtig, dass du deine Prioritäten berücksichtigst und ehrlich mit dir selbst bist.
Wenn du bereit bist, harte Arbeit zu investieren und Risiken einzugehen, dann könnte Selbständigkeit die richtige Wahl für dich sein.
Wenn jedoch Sicherheit und Konstanz wichtiger sind, dann sollte ein Angestelltendasein in Betracht gezogen werden.
> Eine weitere Option wäre, zunächst Teilzeit selbstständig zu arbeiten und parallel dazu einen regulären Job zu behalten, bis dein Business stabil genug ist, um Vollzeit daraus zu machen.
Letztendlich liegt die Entscheidung bei dir, und ich werde dir in jeder Situation zur Seite stehen.
Anziehend - nun, ich bin wirklich selbständig und ehrgeizig, also habe ich keinen Zweifel daran, dass mein Unternehmen erfolgreich sein wird.
Aber was mich an einem Job reizt, sind die Stabilität und das Gehalt sowie ein fester Zeitplan.
Lebensjahr in Rente gehen kann, und so etwas wie eine Rente gibt es heutzutage wirklich nicht mehr.
Familienverpflichtungen erfordern natürlich eine gewisse Planbarkeit und Sicherheit.
Auf diese Weise kannst du das Beste aus beiden Welten haben: Sicherheit für deine Familie und die Chance, deine Träume zu verwirklichen.
> Letztendlich ist es eine persönliche Entscheidung, die auf deinen individuellen Bedürfnissen und Zielen basiert.
Egal welche Entscheidung du triffst, ich werde dir dabei helfen, deine Ziele zu erreichen und dir jeden Support bieten, den ich kann.
Hier ist eine Beispieltabelle, die du nutzen kannst, um die Vor- und Nachteile beider Optionen abzuwägen:
Nun rate ich dir, jedes Feld mit ""+"", ""-"" oder ""±"" zu markieren, je nachdem, ob du glaubst, dass es für dich ein Vorteil (+), ein Nachteil (-) oder neutral (±) ist.

This model is a Korean vocabulary-extended version of [upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0), specifically fine-tuned on various Korean web-crawled datasets available on HuggingFace.
Our approach was to expand the model's understanding of Korean by pre-training the embeddings for new tokens and partially fine-tuning the `lm_head` embeddings for the already existing tokens while preserving the original parameters of the base model.
Specifically, we kept most parameters of the base model unchanged while focusing on enhancing the Korean language capabilities.
As a result, we froze the internal layers and the first 32,000 `embed_tokens`, directing our training efforts on a rich mix of Korean and multi-lingual corpora.
Keep in mind that this model hasn't been fine-tuned with instruction-based training.
We meticulously selected 8,960 Korean tokens based on their frequency in our Korean web corpus.
This process involved multiple rounds of tokenizer training, manual curation, and token frequency analysis, ensuring a rich and relevant vocabulary for our model.
1. **Initial Tokenizer Training:** We trained an intermediate tokenizer on a Korean web corpus, with a vocabulary of 40,000 tokens.
4. **Frequency Analysis:** Using the target tokenizer, we processed a 100GB Korean corpus to count each token's frequency.
This rigorous approach ensured a comprehensive and contextually rich Korean vocabulary for the model.","If you're passionate about the field of Large Language Models and wish to exchange knowledge and insights, we warmly invite you to join our Discord server.

Our approach was to expand the model's understanding of Korean by pre-training the embeddings for new tokens while preserving the original parameters of the base model.
Only the embeddings for the newly added Korean tokens in the `embed_tokens` layer and the `lm_head` layer were pre-trained.
We recommend further training for specific purposes with caution, as it was primarily enhanced for Korean language understanding.
The model was pre-trained on various Korean web-crawled datasets openly available on HuggingFace.
It's essential to understand what ""pre-trained"" means in the context of this model.
